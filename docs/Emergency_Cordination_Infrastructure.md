# HeaLyri Platform Shift: From App to Emergency Coordination Infrastructure

**Status:** Canonical Direction Document  
**Last Updated:** December 2024  
**Applies To:** Product, Engineering, Partnerships, Fundraising

---

## 1. Executive Summary

HeaLyri is formally shifting from a multi-feature healthcare application to a **national emergency coordination platform**, with emergency response as the primary wedge.

This shift is informed by:
- Proven EMS systems in Kenya (Flare), Nigeria (ERA), Rwanda (912), Ghana, and Zambia
- Validated African business models (subscription, micro-insurance, government contracts)
- Zambia-specific policy signals (Ministry of Health tri-wheel ambulance initiative)

**Core Thesis:**  
> HeaLyri will reduce emergency response times in Zambia from hours to minutes by coordinating government, private, and community responders through a unified, auditable dispatch system.

---

## 2. What HeaLyri Is (Post-Shift)

HeaLyri is:

- A **24/7 emergency coordination platform**
- A **dispatch brain** that assigns the best responder in real time
- A **data and audit layer** for insurers, government, and investors
- A **mobile-first but offline-capable system**
- A **public–private–community integrator**

The mobile app is **one interface** into this system — not the system itself.

---

## 3. What HeaLyri Is Not

- Not a pure peer-to-peer rescue app
- Not an “Uber for ambulances” clone
- Not a feature-complete healthcare super-app (yet)
- Not dependent on high-end ambulances to function

---

## 4. The Three-Tier Emergency Response Model

### Tier 1: Community First Responders
- Trained taxi drivers, boda riders, volunteers
- Arrive in 5–10 minutes
- Provide basic first aid and situational assessment

### Tier 2: Transport
- Informal drivers or formal ambulances
- Assigned based on urgency, distance, availability
- GPS-tracked, status-updated

### Tier 3: Facility
- Clinics and hospitals pre-alerted
- Capacity-aware routing
- Outcome reporting back into system

### Coordination Layer (Core HeaLyri IP)
- 24/7 dispatch center (human + AI-assisted)
- Event-driven state machine
- Real-time tracking
- Full audit trail

---

## 5. Core Emergency Flow (Canonical)

Emergency Trigger (App | Call | SMS)
↓
24/7 Dispatch Center
↓
Parallel Fan-Out:

Responder Assigned

Facility Alerted

Family Updated
↓
Transport + Live Tracking
↓
Facility Arrival
↓
Resolution + Event Logging


**Key Principle:**  
Emergencies are **events with obligations**, not UI actions.

---

## 6. Channels: Offline-First by Design

Every emergency can be triggered via:
- Smartphone app
- Toll-free hotline
- SMS / USSD (Phase 2)

Backend treats all sources uniformly.

---

## 7. Financial Model (Layered)

### Tier 1: Subscriptions (Primary, v1)
- Individual: ~K600/year
- Family: ~K1500/year
- Corporate/employer bundles

### Tier 2: Per-Use (Fallback)
- Emergency always provided
- Transport charged if not subscribed

### Tier 3: Insurance Integration (v2)
- National Health Insurance
- Micro-insurance riders (M-TIBA–style)

### Tier 4: Government Contracts (Scale)
- Ministry pays for system operation
- Per-emergency or annual service fee

---

## 8. Responder Onboarding & Trust Framework

All responders must be:
- Registered (ID, license, background check)
- Trained (basic first aid, emergency transport)
- Certified (issued HeaLyri credentials)
- Equipped (basic first aid kit)
- Audited (ratings, response metrics)

Trust is enforced by **data, not reputation**.

---

## 9. Data Is a First-Class Product

Every emergency captures:

### Time Metrics
- Call received
- Assigned
- Arrived
- Transport started
- Facility arrival
- Resolution

### Outcome Metrics
- Triage level
- Services provided
- Final disposition

### Quality Metrics
- Response time by zone
- Responder performance
- Facility feedback

### Financial Metrics
- Cost per incident
- Payment source
- Revenue vs expense

This data enables:
- Insurance pricing
- Ministry reporting
- Investor diligence
- Continuous optimization

---

## 10. Phased Rollout Strategy

### Phase 1 (Months 1–3): MVP
- Lusaka pilot
- 20–50 trained drivers
- 10 facilities
- Lean dispatch center
- App + hotline

### Phase 2 (Months 4–9): Partnership
- Ministry pilot (tri-wheel ambulances)
- Insurance integration
- Corporate clients
- Copperbelt expansion

### Phase 3 (Months 10–24): National Platform
- Multi-province coverage
- Government integration
- 100k+ subscribers
- Exportable model

---

## 11. Implications for the App

### Deprioritized (Frozen)
- Telehealth backend
- Advanced AI triage
- Complex appointment logic

### Prioritized
- Emergency trigger UX
- Live status updates
- Trust signaling
- Responder & facility views

The app exists to **communicate commitment and progress**, not features.

---

## 12. Success Definition

HeaLyri is successful when:
- Emergencies are handled reliably
- Response times are measured and improving
- Government depends on the system
- Insurers price against the data
- Users trust the button with their lives

---

## Final Statement

HeaLyri is not inventing emergency care.  
It is **operationalizing what already works in Africa**, for Zambia, with discipline, data, and partnerships.

The platform’s value is not in novelty —  
it is in **coordination, accountability, and scale**.
